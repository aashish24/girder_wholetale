    Uploads local or remote files to a DataONE repository.

     There are four cases that need to be handled.
        1. The file  was uploaded directly to Whole Tale and physically exists in Girder.
           In this case, a metadata document needs to be generated for each local file. This
           involves hashing the file, and extracting information about it such as the name,
           description, etc. The file and associated metadata record are uploaded to DataONE
           as a pair.

        2. The file was registered from DataONE, and the file record in Whole Tale points to
           its location in DataONE. Since the file is in DataONE, the file can be referenced in
           the resource map, which avoids uploading redundant data. In this case, the only files
           that are created and uploaded are
              1. A pair of an EML record with its metadata
              2. A resource map describing the package contents

        3. The file was registered from an external source, such as Globus. More generally,
           this is the case where the file record has a link to a file on an external resource
           other than DataONE. To handle this, the file needs to be brought onto the Whole Tale
           filesystem. Once on the local system, metadata is generated for the file and the pair
           are uploaded to DataONE. Once uploaded, the file is removed from

        4. A combination of 1, 2, or 3.

    To handle the different cases, the item_ids are, depending on which case they fall under,
     separated into different containers. Each container is then looped over, and the files
